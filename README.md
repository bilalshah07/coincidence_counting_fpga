**Overview:** These source files are to be used with Xilinx Vivado. Import these files as part of your project. Take the codes through the necessary compilation steps, and you will end up with a .bit file that you can use to program the FPGA.

**Source codes:** These files constitute the modules that, when combined, carry out the desired functionality.

**Test benches:** These files are to simulate the circuitry defined by the source codes. User-defined dummy signals can be input to the simulated circuitry, and the output can be observed to confirm the expected behavior.

In case of any confusion, feel free to reach out.
